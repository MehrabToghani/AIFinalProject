# N Queen Solver
We want to find an arrangement of N queens on an N*N chess board, such that no queen can attack any other queens on the board.

To solve it, we used the local search algorithm [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing), so it may not return the correct answer.

## How to run?
<code>python -m lib</code>

## How to use?
After run project, You just need to set number of queens (size of chess board).
<br/>
If it does not return the correct answer, you can use the following options:
- Restart : Runs the algorithm again
- Sequential Restart : Runs the algorithm sequential to find answer
